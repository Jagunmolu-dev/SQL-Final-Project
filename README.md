# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL

## Process
### Created the required database and imported the provided tables into ther database
### Studied the dataset and cleaned the data containing NULL values, or inconsistent datatypes and also deleted redundant columns not needed for analysis

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
1. Deciding on whether to replace null values in numeric fields with 0 or any of the measure of central tendency but i decided to replace with zero because the available values account for less 40% of the data so it would not make sense to use the mean or median.
2. Dealing with Duplicates
3. Inconsistent naming conventions

## Future Goals
DIve more into the data to perform more ststistical analysis on the data
